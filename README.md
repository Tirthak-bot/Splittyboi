# Splittyboi
A Split keyboard with low profile switches,Coded with KMK Firmware.

Note: Couldn't get the render with all the parts together because my laptop kept crashing trying to load in all the parts in the same file. [ It has 4 gigs of RAM so please forgive it :) ]

# Schematic
This is the schematic for a single side, both sides are made identically.
